      Relaxed Cancellation available up to 3 hours before rental starts. 
      Charge will be pending from the time the user submits their reservation and will be 
      processed 3 hours before the rental starts. Late cancellation charges full amount 
      for amount of time agreed upon, up to 24 hours. Service fees and applicable taxes 
      for the full length of the original reservation are still due. Reservations are officially 
      cancelled with the user clicks the “Cancel Reservation” button on the cancellation 
      confirmation page. If rental is returned early, remaining reservation time up to 24 hours is still due. 
      LendIt will mediate when necessary and retains final say in all disputes which may arise.
